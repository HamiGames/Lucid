SPEC-1C — Lucid RDP: Tokenomics, Wallet, Client Controls & Execution
Reward Policy Addendum (Finalized & Immutable)
Fixed Block Rate
slotDurationSec = 120s ? max 30 blocks/hour (immutable).
Fallback Publisher & Reward
If a slot observes no sessions, the Server (Original node) must publish the block and receives a fixed reward of 2 LUCID (exempt from halving/stabilizer).
Halving Schedule (Supply?Driven)
Max supply reference: 42,000,000,000 LUCID.
Halving trigger: every 2.1B tokens minted (5% of max), the per?block maximum reward halves; never below 1.
slotMax(H) = max(1, floor( 50 / 2^H )) where H = floor(totalMinted / 2_100_000_000).
Node?Density?Aware Reward
Inputs per slot: S_t sessions, N_active_t active nodes, B_t total compressed bytes; BASE_MB_PER_SESSION (default 5 MB).
Work units: W_t = max(S_t, ceil(B_t / BASE_MB_PER_SESSION)); density: D_t = W_t / max(1, N_active_t).
Reward: with minReward=1, g_sessions = clamp((S_t-1)/9,0,1), g_density = 0 if D_t < D_min else (D_t-D_min)/(1-D_min); reward_raw = minReward + floor((slotMax(H) - minReward) * g_sessions * g_density); stabilizer may scale minting down; if S_t=0 then reward=2.
ParamRegistry: BASE_MB_PER_SESSION (5), D_min (0.2), slotDurationSec (120 fixed), plus stabilizer params elsewhere.

Node Worker Duties — VM Processing & In?House Transfers
Execute/validate VM transactions (LucidAnchors, LucidChunkStore, LucidGovernor, ParamRegistry, LucidToken, EligibilityManager, WorkCreditsOracle).
Index events/receipts; expose proofs; produce VM traces on demand.
Assemble & attest payout batches; relay TRON transfers; reconcile entitlements; only multisig?authorized nodes co?sign.
MongoDB: tx_index, vm_traces, contract_states, payout_batches, transfers_internal, tron_receipts.

Tokenomics & Voting (Transferable Token, Stimulus Targets, Net?of?Fees)
Governance (recap)
One?node?one?vote among eligible nodes (?80% uptime in last 3 months and ?1 LUCID earned). Token balances do not influence votes.
LUCID Token
Transferable ERC?20?style token with monthly snapshot balances (Snapshot_t) for payout apportionment.
Not immediately redeemable; holders lodge monthly claims (then any?time withdrawals once posted to PayoutsVault).
Revenue Split & Stimulus (TRON side)
Split GrossIncome_t: 18% Tax, 2% Management, 40% HoldingsVault, 40% BaseDistributable.
Stimulus: if HoldingsVault ? Goal_k, add 10% × Goal_k to the month’s distributable pool, then decrement HoldingsVault and bump Goal_{k+1} = Goal_k + $5M (20M ? 25M ? 30M ? …).
Per?Token Rate & Net Payout (Local Fee Estimation)
Supply_t = ? Snapshot_t balances; GRate_t = Distributable_t / Supply_t.
Min payout threshold: $10.00 USD pre?fee ? smaller entitlements roll to next month.
TRON fee from local full node (energy/bandwidth, staked resources, configured TRX?USD), no external oracle. Receivable = Gross ? NetworkFee ? PlatformFee%.
Worked Examples
Stimulus: Goal 20M, Income 100k, Supply 1M ? Distributable = 2,040,000 ? $2.04/token; 10k tokens ? $20,400 gross (minus fees); HoldingsVault ? 18M; next goal 25M.
No stimulus: Distributable 40k ? $0.04/token; 10k tokens ? $400 gross (minus fees).

Wallet & Cash?Out (USDT Direct Only)
Any?time withdrawals after monthly entitlements are posted; $10 pre?fee minimum.
TRX staking for Energy/Bandwidth; per?holder prepay option; TRX buffer targets.
USDT off?ramp connectors: Exchange/OTC/PSP to bank/PayPal (after fiat conversion). No XRP bridge in MVP.
Controls: 2?of?3 multisig approvals; off?ramp platform fee (%) supported; daily/tx caps in ParamRegistry.

Client?Controlled Session Policy & Connection Paths (P2P)
Client?Enforced Controls (Trust?Nothing at the Console)
Owner defines a Control Policy for each session; hashed/anchored on?chain with the session ID; signed by owner.
Runtime enforcer on the client blocks disallowed inputs (mouse/keyboard/shell/USB/audio/webcam/clipboard), enforces file allow/deny and replace?same?name guard, and applies Privacy Shield (hide client data, redaction zones, app allowlist). Violations terminate the session and log an incident.
Re?entry contracts inherit the exact policyHash (immutable during the contract term).
MongoDB: control_policies with expanded schema.
Rolling Free?Tier & De?Clutter
2 actions per rolling 24h (join/search combined) with per?action TTL enforcement.
If a user owns multiple active session IDs, keep the most recent and archive the rest.
Allowed P2P Paths (Tor?only)
Path 1 — Session Rendezvous: User ? Server/Node ? sessions_db ? session_id, where both parties meet at the session ID.
Path 2 — VM Contract Re?Entry: requires a prior Path?1 session, set phrase + reentry key, fixed term (30d default or 90d option; writer may set up to 2 years), and policy inheritance from the original session.

Concrete Steps
Smart Contracts: Implement/freeze LucidAnchors, PayoutRouterV0, PayoutRouterKYC, PoOT/minter, ParamRegistry; audits.

Wallets: Ledger 2?of?3 multisig; appliance keystore; device binding.
Pi Build: Docker Compose; Tor; Node 20 + TronWeb; MongoDB 7 (arm64); FFmpeg with Pi hardware codecs.
Admin UI: Ledger signing; router toggle; payout and withdrawal flows; policy editor for client controls.
Ops: TRX staking/energy rental; monitoring; daily reconciliations.
Milestones
M1 (Week 1?2): Contracts + tests; audit started.
M2 (Week 3): Shasta deploy; Pi image alpha; end?to?end anchor+payout on testnet.
M3 (Week 4): Mainnet deploy; addresses baked; compliance signer live.
M4 (Week 5?6): S?features complete; KYC router wired (optional); performance hardening.
M5 (Week 7): Release Candidate; OTA key rotation; docs.
Gathering Results
On?chain: export anchor/payout txids; cross?check vs local DB.
Performance: <300 ms anchor submit latency (ex?confirmation); <2 s USDT transfer initiation.
Security: quarterly key rotation drill; testnet chaos runs.
