# 🚀 LUCID Core Support Services - Deployment Guide

## BREAKTHROUGH: Core Infrastructure Ready for Pi Deployment

You now have a **GENIUS-LEVEL** complete deployment system for building and deploying the core support services to your Raspberry Pi. This system implements LUCID-STRICT compliance with multi-architecture builds and seamless Pi integration.

## 📋 What's Included

### 🏗️ Core Support Services

- **tor-proxy**: Multi-onion Tor controller (5 static + unlimited dynamic onions)

- **lucid_mongo**: MongoDB 7 replica set with Pi optimization

- **lucid_api**: FastAPI server with health checks

- **lucid_api_gateway**: NGINX reverse proxy

- **tunnel-tools**: Network security tooling

- **server-tools**: Utilities and diagnostics

### 🛠️ Deployment Scripts

1. **`scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh`** - Master orchestration script

1. **`scripts/devcontainer/build-and-push-core-support.sh`** - Build & push to Docker Hub

1. **`scripts/deployment/deploy-to-pi.sh`** - Pi deployment automation

## 🚀 Quick Start Deployment

### Step 1: Complete Deployment (Recommended)

```bash

# Run from DevContainer - builds all services and deploys to Pi

./scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh

# This will:

# 1. Verify environment and connectivity

# 2. Build multi-arch images (AMD64 + ARM64)

# 3. Push to Docker Hub (pickme/lucid)

# 4. Deploy to Pi (pickme@192.168.0.75)

# 5. Verify deployment and show status

```

### Step 2: Alternative - Split Deployment

```bash

# Build only (in DevContainer)

./scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh build-only

# Deploy only (after build complete)

./scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh deploy-only

```

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Development Environment

- ✅ DevContainer running (for Docker-in-Docker + Buildx)

- ✅ Docker Hub authentication: `docker login`

- ✅ Multi-platform buildx support

### Raspberry Pi Environment

- ✅ Pi accessible at `pickme@192.168.0.75`

- ✅ SSH key authentication configured

- ✅ Docker installed on Pi

- ✅ Network connectivity

### Verification Commands

```bash

# Test Pi connectivity

./scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh test

# Verify environment

./scripts/devcontainer/build-and-push-core-support.sh preflight

# Test SSH to Pi

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75 "docker --version"

```

## 🌐 Network Architecture

### Dual-Network Design

```bash

lucid_core_net (172.21.0.0/16) - Internal ops plane
├── lucid_mongo (172.21.0.10)
├── tor-proxy (172.21.0.11)
├── lucid_api (172.21.0.12)
├── lucid_api_gateway (172.21.0.13)
├── tunnel-tools (172.21.0.14)
└── server-tools (172.21.0.15)

lucid_dev_net - External devcontainer connectivity

```bash

### Multi-Onion Support

- **Static onions**: 5 pre-configured services

- **Dynamic onions**: Unlimited for wallets/runtime services

- **Cookie auth**: ED25519-V3 format

- **Onion rotation**: Supported for enhanced security

## 📊 Pi Management

### Helper Commands (Run on Pi)

```bash

# SSH to Pi

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75

# Navigate to deployment directory

cd lucid-core

# Check service status and health

./helper.sh status

# View onion addresses

./helper.sh onions

# View service logs

./helper.sh logs
./helper.sh logs tor-proxy  # specific service

# Restart services

./helper.sh restart

# Update services (pull latest images)

./helper.sh update

```

### Service Endpoints (from Pi)

- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8080

- **API Server**: http://localhost:8081

- **MongoDB**: mongodb://localhost:27017

- **Tor SOCKS**: localhost:9050

## 🏗️ Build System Features

### Multi-Architecture Support

- **AMD64**: Development machines

- **ARM64**: Raspberry Pi 5 compatibility

- **Buildx**: Efficient cross-platform builds

- **Registry caching**: Optimized build times

### Image Tags

```bash

pickme/lucid:tor-proxy
pickme/lucid:api-server
pickme/lucid:api-gateway
pickme/lucid:tunnel-tools
pickme/lucid:server-tools

```bash

### Build Args & Labels

- LUCID-STRICT compliance labeling

- Professional org.lucid.* namespace

- Build metadata and timestamps

- Resource optimization for Pi

## 🔒 Security Features

### Container Security

- `no-new-privileges:true`

- `seccomp:unconfined` (Pi compatibility)

- Non-root users where possible

- Resource limits and reservations

### Network Security

- Plane isolation (ops vs external)

- Internal-only Tor access

- Cookie-based Tor authentication

- Professional logging with rotation

### Multi-Onion Architecture

```bash

# Access onion addresses on Pi

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75 'cd lucid-core && ./helper.sh onions'

# Static onions (5 services):

# - API Gateway onion

# - API Server onion

# - Tunnel service onion

# - MongoDB proxy onion

# - Tor control onion

# Dynamic onions (unlimited):

# - Wallet onions (created on-demand)

# - Runtime service onions

```rust

## 📈 Scaling & Integration

### Integration with DevContainer

The core support services use a dual-network approach:

- **Internal network**: `lucid_core_net` for service isolation

- **External network**: `lucid_dev_net` for DevContainer connectivity

### Adding More Services

After core deployment, additional services can:

1. Use the same `lucid_core_net` network

1. Leverage existing MongoDB and Tor infrastructure

1. Create dynamic onions through the tor-proxy service

1. Utilize the established build and deployment patterns

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Issues

```bash

# Clear buildx cache

./scripts/devcontainer/build-and-push-core-support.sh cleanup

# Verify environment

./scripts/devcontainer/build-and-push-core-support.sh preflight

# Check Docker Hub auth

docker info | grep Username

```bash

#### Pi Connection Issues

```bash

# Test connectivity

./scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh test

# Manual SSH test

ssh -v pickme@192.168.0.75

# Check Pi Docker

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75 "docker --version && docker network ls"

```bash

#### Service Issues on Pi

```bash

# SSH to Pi and check status

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75 'cd lucid-core && ./helper.sh status'

# Check specific service logs

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75 'cd lucid-core && docker compose logs tor-proxy'

# Restart problematic service

ssh pickme@192.168.0.75 'cd lucid-core && docker compose restart tor-proxy'

```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Deploy core infrastructure**: Run `./scripts/master-deploy-core-support.sh`

1. **Verify deployment**: Check all services are healthy

1. **Test onion generation**: Verify multi-onion functionality

1. **Monitor performance**: Ensure Pi resource usage is optimal

### Future Development

1. **Build additional services** using this core infrastructure

1. **Implement wallet services** with dynamic onion support

1. **Add blockchain nodes** connecting through the core network

1. **Expand monitoring** and observability features

## 🏆 Success Indicators

After successful deployment, you should see:

- ✅ All 6 core services running on Pi

- ✅ Multi-architecture images in Docker Hub

- ✅ Healthy service status checks

- ✅ 5 static onion addresses generated

- ✅ Dynamic onion creation capability

- ✅ Proper network isolation and connectivity
