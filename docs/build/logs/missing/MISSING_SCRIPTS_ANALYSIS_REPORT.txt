PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION
======================

CRITICAL PRIORITY (6 scripts):
- FFmpeg cross-compilation and hardware acceleration
- Contract deployment to mainnet
- Core service management

HIGH PRIORITY (15 scripts):
- GUI packaging and signing
- Database operations
- Security and key management
- Contract testnet deployment

MEDIUM PRIORITY (5 scripts):
- Database backup/restore
- TPM integration
- System monitoring

---

SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE
========================

MISSING SPEC-2 COMPLIANCE:
- GUI packaging scripts for cross-platform distribution
- Code signing and notarization scripts
- Installer generation scripts

MISSING SPEC-1D COMPLIANCE:
- FFmpeg cross-compilation for Pi V4L2
- Contract deployment automation
- Service startup automation

MISSING SPEC-4 COMPLIANCE:
- Build stage automation scripts
- Health checking and monitoring
- Operational maintenance scripts

---

IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS
==============================

1. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
   - Create FFmpeg cross-compilation scripts
   - Implement contract deployment automation
   - Add core service management scripts

2. SHORT TERM (1-2 weeks):
   - GUI packaging and signing scripts
   - Database operations scripts
   - Security key management scripts

3. MEDIUM TERM (1 month):
   - Monitoring and health scripts
   - TPM integration scripts
   - Advanced backup/restore scripts

---

CONCLUSION
==========

The Lucid RDP project has a solid foundation with 83 existing scripts but requires 
26 additional scripts to achieve full SPEC-1 compliance. The missing scripts 
represent critical gaps in:

- Build and packaging automation
- Hardware acceleration setup
- Contract deployment
- Database operations
- Security management
- Service control
- System monitoring

Priority should be given to the 6 CRITICAL scripts that directly impact core 
functionality, followed by the 15 HIGH priority scripts for complete operational 
capability.

Without these scripts, the project cannot achieve its goal of a fully functional, 
production-ready Lucid RDP system on Raspberry Pi 5.
