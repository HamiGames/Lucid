# DEPLOYMENT FIX COMPLETE - Docker Hub Pull Issue Resolved

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**  
**Impact:** Critical deployment blocker resolved

---

## Executive Summary

The Phase 1 deployment failure was caused by **Docker Compose attempting to BUILD images on the Raspberry Pi instead of PULLING them from Docker Hub**. This occurred because the compose file contained a `build:` section with a relative path context that didn't exist on the Pi.

**Result:** All compose files fixed, deployment now uses pre-built images from Docker Hub.

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Docker Compose Foundation File
**File:** `configs/docker/docker-compose.foundation.yml`  
**Problem:** Auth service had `build:` section instead of `image:` tag

**Changed Lines 226-231:**
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN - Tried to build on Pi)
build:
  context: ../../
  dockerfile: infrastructure/containers/auth/Dockerfile.auth-service
  target: production
  platforms:
    - linux/arm64

# ✅ AFTER (FIXED - Pulls from Docker Hub)
image: pickme/lucid-auth-service:latest-arm64
platform: linux/arm64
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Docker Compose now PULLS image from `pickme/lucid-auth-service:latest-arm64`
- ✅ No build context required on Pi
- ✅ Deployment succeeds without source code

### Fix #2: MongoDB Initialization Path
**File:** `configs/docker/docker-compose.foundation.yml`  
**Problem:** Relative path `./database/init_collections.js` doesn't exist on Pi

**Changed Line 85:**
```yaml
# ❌ BEFORE (BROKEN - Relative path)
volumes:
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/mongodb:/data/db
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/mongodb-config:/data/configdb
  - ./database/init_collections.js:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init_collections.js:ro

# ✅ AFTER (FIXED - Removed relative path)
volumes:
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/mongodb:/data/db
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/mongodb-config:/data/configdb
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ No dependency on relative paths
- ✅ MongoDB init handled by deployment script instead
- ✅ More robust deployment process

### Fix #3: Enhanced MongoDB Initialization
**File:** `scripts/deployment/deploy-phase1-pi.sh`  
**Lines:** 337-347

**Added:**
```bash
# Copy MongoDB init script to Pi
scp -o ConnectTimeout=10 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i "$PI_SSH_KEY_PATH" \
    "$PROJECT_ROOT/database/init_collections.js" \
    "$PI_USER@$PI_HOST:/tmp/init_collections.js" >/dev/null 2>&1

# Execute initialization script
ssh ... "docker exec -i lucid-mongodb mongosh --quiet < /tmp/init_collections.js"
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Complete MongoDB schema initialization
- ✅ All collections, indexes, and validation rules created
- ✅ Temporary file cleaned up after execution

---

## What Was PRESERVED (Intentionally)

### ✅ NVMe Mount Paths
All `/mnt/myssd/Lucid` paths are **CORRECT** and **UNCHANGED**:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/mongodb:/data/db          # ✅ CORRECT
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/redis:/data               # ✅ CORRECT
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/elasticsearch:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data  # ✅ CORRECT
  - /mnt/myssd/Lucid/logs/auth:/app/logs            # ✅ CORRECT
```

**Why:** `/mnt/myssd/Lucid` is the actual NVMe mount point on your Raspberry Pi.

### ✅ Network Configuration
```yaml
networks:
  lucid-pi-network:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.20.0.1
```
**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - No changes needed

### ✅ Public Base Images
```yaml
image: mongo:7                    # ✅ CORRECT - Official ARM64 image
image: redis:7.2                  # ✅ CORRECT - Official ARM64 image
image: elasticsearch:8.11.0       # ✅ CORRECT - Official ARM64 image
```
**Status:** ✅ CORRECT - These pull directly from Docker Hub

---

## Technical Explanation

### Why Docker Compose Failed

When `docker-compose pull` encounters a service with a `build:` section:

1. **Expected behavior (if `image:` tag used):**
   ```
   docker-compose pull → Pull pickme/lucid-auth-service:latest-arm64 from Docker Hub → ✅ Success
   ```

2. **Actual behavior (with `build:` section):**
   ```
   docker-compose pull
   ↓
   See build: section
   ↓
   Attempt to resolve context: ../../ from /opt/lucid/production/
   ↓
   Context resolves to: /opt/ (doesn't exist or no Dockerfile)
   ↓
   ❌ Build fails → Image pull reports failure
   ```

### Architecture Pattern (Now Correct)

```
Windows 11 (Build Host)          Docker Hub (Registry)         Raspberry Pi (Target)
─────────────────────────        ──────────────────────        ─────────────────────
                                                                                     
1. Build ARM64 images       ──▶  2. Store images         ──▶  3. Pull & Run        
   • docker buildx build          • pickme/lucid namespace      • docker-compose pull
   • Platform: linux/arm64        • Tag: latest-arm64           • Platform: linux/arm64
   • Push to Docker Hub           • Public repository           • /mnt/myssd/Lucid   
                                                                                     
Source: Full repo              Source: Built images          Source: Images only   
Cannot run: ARM64 images       All platforms: AMD64/ARM64    Cannot build: No code 
```

## Files Modified

| File | Changes | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `configs/docker/docker-compose.foundation.yml` | • Replaced `build:` with `image:` for auth-service<br>• Removed relative path volume for MongoDB | ✅ Fixed |

## Deployment Workflow (Now Fixed)

### Before Deployment (One-Time Setup)
```bash
# Setup SSH agent (required for passwordless deployment)
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
# Enter passphrase once - agent remembers it for session
```

### Deploy Phase 1 to Pi
```bash
# From Windows 11 console (Git Bash)
cd /c/Users/surba/Desktop/personal/THE_FUCKER/lucid_2/Lucid

# Deploy
bash scripts/deployment/deploy-phase1-pi.sh
```

docker buildx imagetools inspect pickme/lucid-auth-service:latest-arm64
docker buildx imagetools inspect pickme/lucid-mongodb:latest-arm64
docker buildx imagetools inspect pickme/lucid-redis:latest-arm64

# Expected: Shows linux/arm64 platform for each image ✅
```

### From Raspberry Pi (After Deployment)
```bash
# SSH to Pi
ssh pickme@192.168.0.75

# Check running containers
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# Check storage usage
df -h /mnt/myssd/Lucid

# Check logs
ls -la /mnt/myssd/Lucid/logs/
ls -la /mnt/myssd/Lucid/data/
```

## Error Resolution Timeline

| Step | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | "can't see Docker Hub content locally" | **Cause:** Trying to pull ARM64 on AMD64. **Solution:** Use `docker buildx imagetools inspect` |
| 2 | "no matching manifest for linux/amd64" | **Cause:** Images are ARM64 only. **Solution:** ✅ Expected - build for Pi, not Windows |
| 3 | "Failed to create deployment directory" | **Cause:** No passwordless sudo. **Solution:** Setup ssh-agent |
| 4 | "Failed to pull ARM64 images on Pi" | **Cause:** `build:` section in compose. **Solution:** ✅ FIXED - Use `image:` tag |
