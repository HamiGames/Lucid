# Docker Build Error Fixes

This directory contains all the scripts needed to fix the Docker build errors and make images available on Docker Hub.

## Problem Summary

The Docker images weren't available on Docker Hub because:
1. Missing Docker Hub authentication setup
2. Incomplete build execution according to the plan
3. Missing environment configuration files
4. Build dependencies not met

## Solution Files Created

### 1. Authentication & Setup
- **`scripts/registry/setup-dockerhub-auth.sh`** - Docker Hub authentication setup
- **`scripts/registry/cleanup-dockerhub.sh`** - Docker Hub registry cleanup

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **`scripts/config/generate-all-env.sh`** - Generate all environment files
- **`scripts/foundation/validate-build-environment.sh`** - Build environment validation

### 3. Build Scripts
- **`scripts/build/execute-pre-build-phase.sh`** - Pre-build phase execution
- **`scripts/build-phase2-core.sh`** - Phase 2 core services build
- **`scripts/build-phase3-application.sh`** - Phase 3 application services build
- **`scripts/build-phase4-support.sh`** - Phase 4 support services build

### 4. Orchestration
- **`scripts/build/master-build-orchestration.sh`** - Master build orchestration
- **`scripts/build/─quick-fix-docker-images.sh`** - Quick fix script

### 5. Verification
- **`scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.sh`** - TRON isolation verification

## Quick Fix Execution

To immediately fix the build errors and make images available on Docker Hub:

```bash
# Make scripts executable (already done)
chmod +x scripts/build/─quick-fix-docker-images.sh

# Run the quick fix
./scripts/build/─quick-fix-docker-images.sh
```

## Full Build Process

To run the complete build process according to the plan:

```bash
# Run the master orchestration
./scripts/build/master-build-orchestration.sh
```

## Verification

After running the build scripts, verify images are available:

```bash
# Check Docker Hub authentication
docker info | grep "Username: pickme"

# Verify images are accessible
docker pull pickme/lucid-base:python-distroless-arm64
docker pull pickme/lucid-auth-service:latest-arm64
docker pull pickme/lucid-mongodb:latest-arm64

# List all pickme/lucid images
docker search pickme/lucid
```

## Expected Images

After successful execution, these images will be available on Docker Hub:

### Base Images
- `pickme/lucid-base:python-distroless-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-base:java-distroless-arm64`

### Foundation Services (Phase 1)
- `pickme/lucid-auth-service:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-storage-database:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-mongodb:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-redis:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-elasticsearch:latest-arm64`

### Core Services (Phase 2)
- `pickme/lucid-api-gateway:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-service-mesh-controller:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-blockchain-engine:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-session-anchoring:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-block-manager:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-data-chain:latest-arm64`

### Application Services (Phase 3)
- `pickme/lucid-session-pipeline:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-session-recorder:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-chunk-processor:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-session-storage:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-session-api:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-rdp-server-manager:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-xrdp-integration:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-session-controller:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-resource-monitor:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-node-management:latest-arm64`

### Support Services (Phase 4)
- `pickme/lucid-admin-interface:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-tron-client:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-payout-router:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-wallet-manager:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-usdt-manager:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-trx-staking:latest-arm64`
- `pickme/lucid-payment-gateway:latest-arm64`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Authentication Error**: Run `docker login` and authenticate as `pickme`
2. **Build Failure**: Check Docker BuildKit is enabled
3. **Platform Error**: Ensure building for `linux/arm64`
4. **Network Error**: Check internet connectivity and Docker Hub access

## Next Steps

After successful build:
1. Deploy to Raspberry Pi using deployment scripts
2. Run integration tests
3. Configure production environment
4. Monitor system health

## File Locations

All scripts are located in:
- `scripts/registry/` - Docker Hub authentication and cleanup
- `scripts/config/` - Environment configuration
- `scripts/foundation/` - Build environment validation
- `scripts/build/` - Build orchestration and execution
- `scripts/verification/` - Security and isolation verification

This completes the Docker build error fixes and provides a functional solution to make all images available on Docker Hub.
