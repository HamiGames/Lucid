- **Purpose**: Build MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch containers
- **Features**:
  - Builds all three storage containers
  - ARM64 platform targeting
  - Docker Hub push functionality
  - Sequential build process with error handling

### 3. Phase 1 Integration Test Runner

**File**: `tests/integration/phase1/run_phase1_tests.sh`
- **Purpose**: Execute Phase 1 integration tests
- **Features**:
  - Installs required test dependencies
  - Runs pytest with verbose output
  - Error handling and status reporting

### 4. Phase 1 Integration Test Suite

**File**: `tests/integration/phase1/test_phase1_integration.py`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive Phase 1 integration tests
- **Test Coverage**:
  - MongoDB connection and performance testing
  - Redis caching operations
  - Elasticsearch indexing and search
  - Auth service health checks
  - Cross-service communication validation
- **Features**:
  - Async/await support for performance testing
  - Proper cleanup after tests
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Configurable test endpoints

### 5. Phase 1 Docker Compose Validator

**File**: `scripts/validation/validate-phase1-compose.sh`
- **Purpose**: Validate Phase 1 Docker Compose configuration
- **Validation Checks**:
  - Docker Compose file syntax validation
  - Environment file existence
  - Required environment variables presence
  - Error reporting with specific messages

## File Permissions

All shell scripts have been made executable:
- `auth/build-auth-service.sh` - ✅ Executable
- `infrastructure/containers/storage/build-storage-containers.sh` - ✅ Executable
- `tests/integration/phase1/run_phase1_tests.sh` - ✅ Executable
- `scripts/validation/validate-phase1-compose.sh` - ✅ Executable

## Integration with Phase 1 Deployment

These files support the complete Phase 1 Foundation Services deployment workflow:

1. **Build Phase**: Storage containers and auth service containers
2. **Validation Phase**: Docker Compose and environment validation
3. **Testing Phase**: Integration testing of all Phase 1 services
4. **Deployment Phase**: Ready for Pi deployment

## Key Features

### Build Scripts
- **Multi-platform support**: ARM64 targeting for Raspberry Pi
- **Error handling**: Proper error propagation and reporting
- **Docker Hub integration**: Automatic push to registry
- **Sequential builds**: Proper dependency management

### Test Suite
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All Phase 1 services tested
- **Performance testing**: Response time validation
- **Integration testing**: Cross-service communication
- **Cleanup procedures**: Proper test isolation

### Validation Scripts
- **Syntax validation**: Docker Compose file validation
- **Environment validation**: Required variables checking
- **Error reporting**: Clear error messages and exit codes

## Usage

### Build Storage Containers
```bash
./infrastructure/containers/storage/build-storage-containers.sh
```

### Build Auth Service
```bash
./auth/build-auth-service.sh
```

### Validate Phase 1 Configuration
```bash
./scripts/validation/validate-phase1-compose.sh
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
./tests/integration/phase1/run_phase1_tests.sh
```

## Dependencies

### Build Dependencies
- Docker with BuildKit enabled
- Docker Hub access for pushing images
- ARM64 buildx support

### Test Dependencies
- Python 3.11+
- pytest, pytest-asyncio
- requests, pymongo, redis, elasticsearch
- Network access to Pi (192.168.0.75)

### Validation Dependencies
- docker-compose
- Environment files generated
- Docker Compose file present

## Next Steps

1. **Generate environment files** using the fixed environment scripts
2. **Build storage containers** using the build script
3. **Build auth service** using the build script
4. **Validate configuration** using the validation script
5. **Deploy to Pi** using the deployment procedures
6. **Run integration tests** to verify deployment

## Files Status

All Phase 1 missing files have been created and are ready for use:

- ✅ `auth/build-auth-service.sh` - Created and executable
- ✅ `infrastructure/containers/storage/build-storage-containers.sh` - Created and executable
- ✅ `tests/integration/phase1/run_phase1_tests.sh` - Created and executable
- ✅ `tests/integration/phase1/test_phase1_integration.py` - Created
- ✅ `scripts/validation/validate-phase1-compose.sh` - Created and executable

Phase 1 Foundation Services deployment is now fully supported with all required files in place.
