# Step 12: Verify Network Isolation

## Overview
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes  
**Purpose**: Verify network isolation between blockchain core and TRON services to ensure complete separation.

## Pre-Verification Actions

### 1. Check Docker Compose Configurations
```bash
# Check TRON service network configuration
ls -la payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml
cat payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml

# Check blockchain service network configuration
ls -la blockchain/docker-compose.yml
cat blockchain/docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Verify Network Definitions
Before verification, document the expected network isolation configuration.

## Verification Actions

### 1. Verify lucid-network-isolated for TRON Services
**Target**: Check TRON services are deployed to isolated network

**Network**: `lucid-network-isolated` (172.21.0.0/16)

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check TRON Docker Compose network configuration
grep -A 10 -B 5 "lucid-network-isolated" payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml

# Verify TRON network isolation
docker network ls | grep lucid-network-isolated
docker network inspect lucid-network-isolated
```

**Expected Configuration**:
```yaml
# payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml should contain:
networks:
  lucid-network-isolated:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.21.0.0/16
```

### 2. Verify lucid-dev Network for Blockchain Core
**Target**: Check blockchain core services are deployed to dev network

**Network**: `lucid-dev`

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check blockchain Docker Compose network configuration
grep -A 10 -B 5 "lucid-dev" blockchain/docker-compose.yml

# Verify blockchain network isolation
docker network ls | grep lucid-dev
docker network inspect lucid-dev
```

**Expected Configuration**:
```yaml
# blockchain/docker-compose.yml should contain:
networks:
  lucid-dev:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.20.0.0/16
```

### 3. Check Docker Compose Configurations for Network Separation
**Target**: Verify no direct communication between blockchain and TRON

**Files to Check**:
- `payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml`
- `blockchain/docker-compose.yml`

**Verification Commands**:
```bash
# Check TRON service network configuration
grep -r "lucid-dev\|blockchain" payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml
# Should return no results

# Check blockchain service network configuration
grep -r "lucid-network-isolated\|tron" blockchain/docker-compose.yml
# Should return no results
```

## Expected Network Configuration

### TRON Services Network (lucid-network-isolated)
- **Subnet**: 172.21.0.0/16
- **Services**: All TRON payment services
- **Isolation**: Complete separation from blockchain core

### Blockchain Core Network (lucid-dev)
- **Subnet**: 172.20.0.0/16
- **Services**: All blockchain core services
- **Isolation**: Complete separation from TRON services

## Validation Steps

### 1. Verify Network Isolation
```bash
# Check TRON services are on isolated network
docker-compose -f payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml ps
docker network inspect lucid-network-isolated

# Check blockchain services are on dev network
docker-compose -f blockchain/docker-compose.yml ps
docker network inspect lucid-dev
```

### 2. Test Network Separation
```bash
# Test that TRON services cannot reach blockchain services
docker exec -it tron-service ping blockchain-service
# Should fail or timeout

# Test that blockchain services cannot reach TRON services
docker exec -it blockchain-service ping tron-service
# Should fail or timeout
```

### 3. Verify No Cross-Network Communication
```bash
# Check for any cross-network references
grep -r "lucid-dev" payment-systems/tron/
grep -r "lucid-network-isolated" blockchain/
# Should return no results
```

## Expected Results

### After Verification
- [ ] TRON services deployed to lucid-network-isolated (172.21.0.0/16)
- [ ] Blockchain services deployed to lucid-dev (172.20.0.0/16)
- [ ] No direct communication between networks
- [ ] Complete network isolation achieved
- [ ] No cross-contamination between systems

### Network Isolation Verification
```
TRON Services (lucid-network-isolated):
├── tron-client (172.21.0.2)
├── tron-payment-service (172.21.0.3)
├── tron-network (172.21.0.4)
└── tron-wallets (172.21.0.5)

Blockchain Services (lucid-dev):
├── blockchain-engine (172.20.0.2)
├── blockchain-anchor (172.20.0.3)
├── contract-deployment (172.20.0.4)
└── blockchain-api (172.20.0.5)
```

## Testing

### 1. Network Configuration Test
```bash
# Test TRON network configuration
docker-compose -f payment-systems/tron/docker-compose.yml config
# Should show lucid-network-isolated network

# Test blockchain network configuration
docker-compose -f blockchain/docker-compose.yml config
# Should show lucid-dev network
```

### 2. Network Isolation Test
```bash
# Test TRON service isolation
docker exec -it tron-client ping blockchain-engine
# Should fail or timeout

# Test blockchain service isolation
docker exec -it blockchain-engine ping tron-client
# Should fail or timeout
```

### 3. Service Communication Test
```bash
# Test TRON service internal communication
docker exec -it tron-client ping tron-payment-service
# Should succeed

# Test blockchain service internal communication
docker exec -it blockchain-engine ping blockchain-anchor
# Should succeed
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Networks Don't Exist
1. Create networks using Docker commands
2. Update Docker Compose configurations
3. Verify network definitions

### If Cross-Network Communication Exists
1. Check Docker Compose configurations
2. Verify network isolation settings
3. Update service configurations

### If Services Can't Communicate
1. Check network configurations
2. Verify service dependencies
3. Ensure proper network assignment

## Success Criteria

### Must Complete
- [ ] TRON services deployed to lucid-network-isolated
- [ ] Blockchain services deployed to lucid-dev
- [ ] No direct communication between networks
- [ ] Complete network isolation achieved
- [ ] No cross-contamination between systems

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Final verification
docker network ls | grep lucid
# Should show both networks

# Test isolation
docker exec -it tron-client ping blockchain-engine
# Should fail or timeout

# Test internal communication
docker exec -it tron-client ping tron-payment-service
# Should succeed
```

## Next Steps
After completing this verification, proceed to Step 13: Review Step 15 Session Management Pipeline

## Rollback Plan
If issues are encountered:
```bash
# Return to pre-cleanup state
git checkout pre-tron-cleanup
```
