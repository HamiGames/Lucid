# Step 10: Run TRON Isolation Verification

## Overview
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes  
**Purpose**: Run comprehensive TRON isolation verification to ensure 100% compliance score and zero violations in blockchain/ directory.

## Pre-Verification Actions

### 1. Ensure Verification Scripts Exist
```bash
# Check if verification scripts exist
ls -la scripts/verification/
ls -la tests/isolation/
```

### 2. Create Verification Scripts if Missing
If scripts don't exist, create them using the commands from Step 1.

## Verification Actions

### 1. Run Shell Verification Script
**Target**: Execute shell-based TRON isolation verification

**Command**:
```bash
# Run shell verification script
./scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.sh
```

**Expected Output**:
- Zero TRON references found in blockchain/ directory
- 100% compliance score
- No violations reported

### 2. Run Python Verification Script
**Target**: Execute Python-based TRON isolation verification

**Command**:
```bash
# Run Python verification script
python scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.py
```

**Expected Output**:
- Zero TRON violations found
- 100% compliance score
- No TRON references in blockchain/ directory

### 3. Run TRON Isolation Tests
**Target**: Execute comprehensive TRON isolation test suite

**Command**:
```bash
# Run TRON isolation tests
pytest tests/isolation/test_tron_isolation.py -v
```

**Expected Output**:
- All tests pass
- Zero TRON violations detected
- 100% isolation compliance

## Expected Results

### After Verification
- [ ] 100% compliance score achieved
- [ ] Zero violations in blockchain/ directory
- [ ] All verification scripts pass
- [ ] All isolation tests pass
- [ ] TRON isolation fully implemented

### Compliance Metrics
- **Total Violations**: 0 (down from 149)
- **Files Affected**: 0 (down from 7)
- **Compliance Score**: 100% (up from 0%)
- **Risk Level**: LOW (down from HIGH)

## Validation Steps

### 1. Verify Zero TRON References
```bash
# Check for any remaining TRON references in blockchain/
grep -r "tron\|TRON" blockchain/ --include="*.py"
# Should return no results
```

### 2. Verify Compliance Score
```bash
# Run compliance verification
python scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.py
# Should return: 100% compliance score
```

### 3. Verify Isolation Tests
```bash
# Run isolation tests
pytest tests/isolation/test_tron_isolation.py -v
# Should return: All tests passed
```

## Testing

### 1. Shell Script Test
```bash
# Test shell verification script
./scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.sh
# Should return: Zero violations found
```

### 2. Python Script Test
```bash
# Test Python verification script
python scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.py
# Should return: 100% compliance score
```

### 3. Test Suite Test
```bash
# Test isolation test suite
pytest tests/isolation/test_tron_isolation.py -v
# Should return: All tests passed
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Verification Scripts Don't Exist
1. Create verification scripts using commands from Step 1
2. Ensure scripts are executable
3. Verify script paths are correct

### If TRON References Still Exist
1. Check for case variations: `Tron`, `TRON`, `tron`
2. Verify all files were cleaned properly
3. Check for partial matches in comments

### If Tests Fail
1. Verify TRON services are properly isolated
2. Check payment-systems/tron/ directory
3. Ensure no cross-contamination between systems

## Success Criteria

### Must Complete
- [ ] 100% compliance score achieved
- [ ] Zero violations in blockchain/ directory
- [ ] All verification scripts pass
- [ ] All isolation tests pass
- [ ] TRON isolation fully implemented

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Final verification
./scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.sh
# Should return: Zero violations found

# Python verification
python scripts/verification/verify-tron-isolation.py
# Should return: 100% compliance score

# Test suite verification
pytest tests/isolation/test_tron_isolation.py -v
# Should return: All tests passed
```

## Next Steps
After completing this verification, proceed to Step 11: Update Import Statements Project-Wide

## Rollback Plan
If issues are encountered:
```bash
# Return to pre-cleanup state
git checkout pre-tron-cleanup
```
