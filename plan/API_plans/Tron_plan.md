# TRON Payment System API Build Guide - Distroless Implementation

## Document Purpose

This build guide provides comprehensive documentation for addressing all identified API problems in the TRON Payment System, with future-proof solutions optimized for distroless container deployment. It serves as the master reference for implementing secure, isolated, and maintainable payment APIs aligned with SPEC-1B-v2 requirements.

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Build Guide Document Structure
- **File**: `plan/API_plans/TRON_PAYMENT_API_BUILD_GUIDE.md`
- **Sections**:
  - Executive Summary
  - Problem Analysis (all 10 problems)
  - Solution Architecture
  - Implementation Roadmap
  - API Specifications (OpenAPI 3.0)
  - Distroless Container Configurations
  - Security & Compliance
  - Testing & Validation
  - Deployment & Monitoring
  - Future-Proofing Strategies
  - Appendices (code examples, configs)

### Task 2: Document Problem Analysis
- Detail each of the 10 identified API problems
- Include current state analysis
- Document distroless impact
- Provide root cause analysis
- Cross-reference with project specifications

### Task 3: Define Solution Architecture
- Unified Python-based implementation (per user choice)
- API Gateway proxy integration (per user choice)
- OpenAPI 3.0 schema definitions
- Distroless container architecture

- Raspberry Pi deployment procedures
- Rollback strategies
- Monitoring & alerting setup

### Task 9: Future-Proofing Strategies
- API versioning strategy
- Backward compatibility guidelines
- Migration path documentation
- Scaling considerations
- Performance optimization techniques
- Emerging technology integration plans

### Task 10: Create Supporting Artifacts

## Document Organization

The build guide will be organized as follows:

1. **Front Matter**
   - Document control information
   - Version history
   - Approval signatures
   - Change log

2. **Main Content**
   - Organized by problem → solution → implementation
   - Each section stands alone but cross-references others
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Practical examples throughout

3. **Appendices**
   - Complete code examples
   - Configuration templates
   - Reference architecture diagrams
   - Glossary of terms
   - Related specifications index

---

## Key Deliverables

1. **Master Build Guide Document** (`TRON_PAYMENT_API_BUILD_GUIDE.md`)
   - 50-75 pages comprehensive guide
   - Markdown format for version control
   - Structured for easy navigation
   - Searchable and linkable sections

2. **OpenAPI Specifications** (embedded in guide + separate file)
   - Complete API contract definitions
   - Machine-readable format
   - Auto-generated documentation capability

3. **Dockerfile Templates** (appendix)
   - Multi-stage build patterns
   - Security-hardened configurations
   - Platform-specific optimizations

4. **Implementation Checklists** (embedded)
   - Step-by-step validation
   - Acceptance criteria for each problem
   - Testing verification procedures

---

## Success Criteria

- All 10 identified problems documented with solutions
- Complete API specifications ready for implementation
- Distroless container strategy fully defined
- Security & compliance requirements addressed
- Testing strategy covers all scenarios
- Deployment procedures ready for execution
- Future-proofing strategies documented
- Supporting artifacts ready for use

---

## Timeline Estimate

- Task 1-2: Structure & Problem Analysis (document foundation)
- Task 3-4: Architecture & API Specs (core technical content)
- Task 5-6: Container & Security (implementation details)
- Task 7-8: Testing & Deployment (operational procedures)
- Task 9-10: Future-Proofing & Artifacts (supporting materials)

Total: Comprehensive build guide ready for team review and implementation
