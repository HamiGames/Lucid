# Container Build Strategy & Implementation Plan

## ðŸ“‹ **ANALYSIS: DevContainer vs Pi SSH Connection**

Based on SPEC-4 analysis and current infrastructure, here are the **recommended approaches**:

### **âœ… RECOMMENDATION: Use DevContainer for Development & Initial Build**

**Why DevContainer is Best for First Multi-File Container Set:**

1. **âœ… Environment Consistency** - All dependencies pre-installed and tested
2. **âœ… Development Integration** - VS Code + Docker seamlessly integrated  
3. **âœ… Port Forwarding Ready** - All required ports already configured
4. **âœ… Network Isolation** - Proper container networking established
5. **âœ… Build Tools Available** - Docker buildx, compose, all required toolchain
6. **âœ… AMD64 Compatibility** - Works perfectly on your Windows system

### **ðŸ”„ Pi SSH Connection - Use for Edge Deployment Later**

**When to Use Pi System:**
- **Stage 3+ Node Systems** (node-worker, node-data-host) - Pi hardware encoding
- **Production Edge Deployment** - ARM64 native performance
- **Hardware-Specific Testing** - xrdp/FFmpeg with Pi HW acceleration

## ðŸŽ¯ **IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: DevContainer Foundation (RECOMMENDED START)**

**Build Order Based on SPEC-4:**

```
Stage 0 (Common & Base) âœ… DONE - DevContainer built
â”œâ”€â”€ Stage 1: Blockchain Group ðŸŽ¯ START HERE
â”œâ”€â”€ Stage 2: Sessions Group 
â”œâ”€â”€ Stage 3: Node Systems Group (Move to Pi later)
â”œâ”€â”€ Stage 4: Admin/Wallet Group
â”œâ”€â”€ Stage 5: Observability Group  
â””â”€â”€ Stage 6: Relay/Directory (Optional)
```

## ðŸš€ **STEP 1: Create Missing Materials**

### **1.1 Main Docker Compose File (Missing)**

SPEC-4 requires `/compose/docker-compose.yml` with multi-profile support:
